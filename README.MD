# Sum of project

- I enjoyed while i try to remember ReactJS. I was not deploy a project with React for a long while so this project made me happy. I've never used Graphql until this project and my opinion about Graphql is : "OH MY GOODNESS. IT IS REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, ... AWESOME/AMAZING/INCREDIBLE AND BLA BLA BLA" ðŸ˜Š.

- I wrote  ***I completed*** this project but actually it is not completed for me cause there are ***some more features*** I wanna add but I don't have time. Anyway as I wrote, I really enjoyed while I was coding this project and I feel better.
